# **Flappy bird in python**

###### This is a basic flappy bird alike game made with Python and Tkinter.
###### That said, we want to build an AI to learn basics of artificial intelligence, that would in this case always be better than the player.

###### Even if it is a homework, we aim to complete the project as well as we could.
###### We are two teenagers interested by IT and we are quite autonomous, but any advices concerning the AI is welcome ;)
